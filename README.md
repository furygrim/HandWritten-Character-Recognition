# ✍️ Handwritten Character Recognition

This project implements a real-time handwritten character recognition system using a webcam and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on the EMNIST dataset (Extended MNIST), which contains handwritten letters, to accurately classify characters as they are drawn or written in front of the camera.
